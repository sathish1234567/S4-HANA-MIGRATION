ECC to S/4HANA projects- Migration steps with ABAP code


ChatGPT said:
Migrating from SAP ECC to S/4HANA is a major transformation project that involves technical, functional, and ABAP custom code migration.

Below is a high-level guide covering:

‚úÖ ECC to S/4HANA Migration Steps

üß© ABAP Custom Code Migration Process

üß™ Useful Tools

üõ†Ô∏è Sample ABAP Adjustments/Code Examples

‚úÖ 1. ECC to S/4HANA Migration Steps (Simplified)
Phase	Description
1. Assessment & Planning	Evaluate existing ECC system, custom objects, and decide migration approach (Greenfield, Brownfield, or Hybrid)
2. System Preparation	Upgrade SPAM, SUM tools, install Maintenance Planner files
3. Custom Code Analysis	Run ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC), Custom Code Migration App
4. Data Cleansing	Archive or correct outdated data (master/transactional)
5. System Conversion	Use Software Update Manager (SUM) with Database Migration Option (DMO)
6. Post-Conversion Activities	Functional testing, code remediation, and optimization
7. Go-live & Support	Final checks, system cutover, and hypercare support

üß© 2. ABAP Code Migration: Key Steps
SAP S/4HANA removes/replaces many ECC-specific objects and tables. ABAP code must be cleaned up accordingly.

üöÄ Steps:
Install Custom Code Migration Worklist App

T-code: SYCM

Run ATC Checks (ABAP Test Cockpit)

T-code: ATC or run from Eclipse ADT

Use variant: S4HANA_READINESS_<version>

Identify:

Obsolete transactions, function modules

Direct SELECTs from old tables (BSID, VBRK, MSEG, etc.)

Usage of classical BAPIs that are deprecated

Adjust custom code based on ATC findings

üõ†Ô∏è 3. Common Adjustments in ABAP Code
‚ùå Example: Deprecated Table (BSID)
abap
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM BSID INTO TABLE lt_bsids WHERE kunnr = lv_kunnr.
‚úÖ Replacement: Use CDS View (like I_BillingDocument)
abap
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM I_CustomerOpenItem WHERE Customer = lv_kunnr INTO TABLE lt_open_items.
‚ùå Example: SELECT on MSEG (replaced with CDS views)
abap
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM MSEG INTO TABLE lt_mseg WHERE matnr = lv_matnr.
‚úÖ Recommended: CDS-based logic
abap
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM I_MaterialDocumentItem WHERE Material = lv_matnr INTO TABLE lt_material_docs.
üß™ 4. Useful Tools
Tool	Purpose
ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit)	Find syntax and compatibility issues
SCI (Code Inspector)	Deep inspection of custom objects
CDMC (Custom Development Management Cockpit)	Usage tracking
SYCM (Custom Code Migration App)	Generate worklist
SUM (Software Update Manager)	System conversion
SNOTE	Apply relevant OSS notes
Eclipse ADT	Mandatory for new ABAP development in S/4HANA

üí° Tips for Clean Migration
Clean up unused Z objects (use usage stats via CDMC)

Replace APPEND + SORT with SORTED/HASHED TABLES

Avoid direct database updates (MODIFY dbtab)

Replace WRITE, SELECTION-SCREEN, etc. with Fiori/UI5-based output where applicable

Check BDCs‚Äîthey may break; prefer BAPIs or Fiori APIs

üîß ABAP Code Example: Table Replacement Using CDS View
Before (ECC)
abap
Copy
Edit
SELECT SINGLE * FROM VBRK INTO ls_vbrk WHERE vbeln = lv_vbeln.
After (S/4HANA)
abap
Copy
Edit
SELECT SINGLE * FROM I_BillingDocumentBasic WHERE BillingDocument = lv_vbeln INTO @DATA(ls_vbrk).

Custom Code Worklist (in Excel) in S4 HANA migration


ChatGPT said:
Creating a Custom Code Worklist in Excel is a key part of an SAP S/4HANA migration project. This helps you track which ABAP custom developments need changes due to incompatibilities, simplifications, or obsolete elements in S/4HANA.

Below is a complete guide to generate it:

‚úÖ Objective:
To generate a Custom Code Worklist (Excel format) that lists:

Custom objects (Z* programs, tables, FMs, etc.)

Impact (S/4 incompatible, simplifications, deleted elements)

Remediation notes/actions

Responsible developer/team

Status (Open/In Progress/Completed)

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Required:
Tool	Purpose
SAP Custom Code Migration App (SYCM)	Identify impacted custom code
ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit)	Run detailed checks
Eclipse ADT	For analyzing and fixing code
SAP Readiness Check (optional)	Consolidated view of readiness

üîÅ Step-by-Step: Generate Worklist in Excel
üîπ Step 1: Run SYCM in ECC System (Optional Pre-check)
Transaction: SYCM_DOWNLOAD_REPOSITORY_INFO
This collects repository data (custom programs, function groups, classes, etc.).

Download the repository info as a ZIP file.

Upload it later to your S/4HANA system or Custom Code Migration Fiori App.

üîπ Step 2: Run ATC in S/4HANA System
Use ATC (Transaction: ATC) or via Eclipse ADT:

Configuration:
Setup Central Check System

Use check variant: S4HANA_READINESS_<version> or S4HANA_ALL

Scope: Select Z* objects only or entire package

Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
ATC ‚Üí Schedule Runs ‚Üí Create New Run
üîπ Step 3: Export ATC Results to Excel
After the ATC run:

Go to: ATC ‚Üí Manage Results

Open your run result ‚Üí Click ‚ÄúExport‚Äù

Choose Export to Excel or CSV

This gives a detailed Excel with:

Object Name	Type	Priority	Error Type	Message	Correction Note

üîπ Step 4: Use SAP Fiori App: Custom Code Migration (Optional)
If using Fiori:

App: Custom Code Migration

Import ZIP from ECC (Step 1)

Analyze usage and compatibility

Export results as Excel

üìò Sample Worklist Format (Excel Columns)
Object Name	Object Type	Issue Category	Description	SAP Note/Link	Action Needed	Status	Owner	Comments
ZMMR001	Report	Obsolete DB Table	Uses MSEG	View I_MaterialDocItem	Replace DB access with CDS	In Progress	Ravi	Mapped CDS in dev
ZSD_FUNC01	FM	Deleted FM	CALL FUNCTION 'GET_VAT'	-	Replace logic	Open	Suresh	Obsolete FM

üìé Pro Tip:
You can also enhance the Excel sheet by adding:

ATC Priority (High/Medium/Low)

Suggested replacement (CDS views, new APIs)

Target completion date

‚úÖ Summary
Step	Action
1	Run SYCM (ECC) or start directly in S/4
2	Execute ATC using S4HANA_READINESS check
3	Export ATC results to Excel
4	Create remediation plan from exported file
