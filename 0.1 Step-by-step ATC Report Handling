Step-by-step ATC Report Handling


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a step-by-step guide to handling ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit) reports during SAP ECC to S/4HANA migration:

🎯 Goal:
Use ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit) to detect and fix custom code issues that are incompatible with S/4HANA (like obsolete tables, functions, or syntax).

✅ Step-by-Step ATC Report Handling
🔹 STEP 1: Setup ATC System Landscape
Option A: Run ATC Locally
Use when both ECC and S/4 are on same system (POC/testing)

Option B: Central Check System (Recommended for migration)
Install ATC on S/4HANA system (Central)

Connect ECC (remote check system)

Configure in Transaction: ATC

🔹 STEP 2: Create and Activate Check Variant
Use SAP's predefined variant for S/4HANA:

S4HANA_READINESS_<version> (e.g., S4HANA_READINESS_2022)

S4HANA_DEPRECATED, S4HANA_OBSOLETE

T-code: ATC

Navigate to "Check Variants"

You can customize the variant if needed

🔹 STEP 3: Run ATC Check on Custom Code
Go to T-code: ATC

Choose "Schedule Runs"

Enter:

Check Variant: S4HANA_READINESS_2022

Package or object name: (e.g., Z*)

Click “Schedule”

🕒 ATC will now analyze your selected objects.

🔹 STEP 4: View & Analyze ATC Results
Go to: ATC → Manage Results

Select your run → Expand object list

For each finding, it shows:

Object Name (Program/Fugr/FM)

Message ID (e.g., "Table MSEG is obsolete")

Priority (1=high, 3=low)

Simplification Item / SAP Note (sometimes linked)

✅ Tip: Double-click on error to jump directly into affected code in SE80 or Eclipse ADT.

🔹 STEP 5: Categorize & Filter Findings
Category	Example	Action
Obsolete DB Access	SELECT * FROM MSEG	Replace with CDS views (I_MaterialDocumentItem)
Deprecated FM/BAPI	CALL FUNCTION 'GET_VAT'	Replace with recommended APIs
Syntax/Keyword issues	WRITE, TOP-OF-PAGE	Refactor using modern syntax
BDC Issues	CALL TRANSACTION 'ME21N'	Switch to BAPI or Fiori

📄 Export ATC findings to Excel for worklist creation.

🔹 STEP 6: Fix Code (Refactoring)
Use:

CDS Views instead of Tables (e.g., BSID → I_CustomerOpenItem)

New BAPIs / Fiori APIs instead of old FMs

Eclipse ADT for latest ABAP features & testing

✔ Test each fix in DEV system
✔ Document in Excel worklist
